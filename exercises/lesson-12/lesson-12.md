# Lesson 12 exercises
## Extending MTG Collection Central
One of the most (in)famous crypto currency exchanges Mt. Gox[^7] started out as a trading platform for Magic: The Gathering Online cards before pivoting into crypto. Check out the story[^8] while coding this exercise 

## Exercise 12-1
### Get up and running
Open the .NET project located in `examples/lesson-12-persisting-data-with-mongo-db/mtg-collection`

1. Start the database by running `docker compose up` in the project root
2. The Docker stack contains a MongoDB[^5] running on port 27018 and Mongo Express[^6] instance running @ http://localhost:5050/. The user and password can be found in `examples/lesson-12-persisting-data-with-mongo-db/mtg-collection/docker-compose.yaml`
3. Start the application. The database should be seeded automatically when navigating opening https://localhost:5000 in a browser

## Exercise 12-2
### Filter by artist
We want to be able to explore the awesome art of the game, so we need to be able to filter based on artist

1. Add a new field to the model in `examples/lesson-12-persisting-data-with-mongo-db/mtg-collection/Pages/Index.cshtml` 
2. Update the filter in `examples/lesson-12-persisting-data-with-mongo-db/mtg-collection/Services/CardService.cs` to include artist name

## Exercise 12-3
### Add pagination to `Index`
Right now, everything is fine since we are only loading 783 cards. But there are more than 22.630 unique cards printed (in more than 49.900 variants). This would be a lot of data to handle for the browser, and does not exactly account for at great user experience, so we need to add pagination[^3]. You can find some information and inspiration[^4], and when you are ready add it to `Index.cshtml`[^9].

1. Add (or update) a handler that will paginate the card collection so it only return at most 50 cards per page

## Exercise 12-4
### Add card search to `Decks/Details`
Add a search feature in the details page, where you can add cards to the deck.

## Exercise 12-5
### Add more cards
Add the data in `exercises/lesson-12/drk.json`. You will have to fix the JSON before it will be processed. Remember to remove the database between each run in order to seed the database. You can use the Mongo Express website @ http://localhost:5050 or MongoDB Compass (get it @ https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass)

If you are having too good of a day, check out the set(s) Apocalyse and/or Innistrad on Scryfall[^1] (you can find more information about the model[^2] on their site)
